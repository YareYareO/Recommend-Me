A website to find and contribute references to historical, or otherwise interesting information.

The site lets you search for information based on tags. Tags include everything from Things like People, Pieces of media, Events, Places to descriptions like Fictional, Time it was created, Genre. In total there are 100 Tags to choose from, combinable as wished during search, and sorted in a hierarchy. A diagram of all Tags is in the root folder "Tag-Map.jpg"

Current 'production' https://recme.azurewebsites.net/
Obviously, i do not have a dedicated domain. App and SQL Server hosted by Azure.
The app itself is developed in ASP.NET Core. No frontend framework was used. (Almost) Purely serverside stuff.

Currently on the production website, creating an account is not possible. I might provide a dummy account.

I will try to regularly add entries in the production database so that it does not look that empty.

The Mouseion (or Museum) of Alexandria in ancient Egypt was a renowned center of learning and scholarship that housed a vast collection of texts and artifacts and was dedicated to the pursuit of knowledge and intellectual activities.
(This might be one piece of information one can contribute to the website)

I am a Business-IT student from germany. I work alone on this project. I want to release this some day, so wish me good fortune.
