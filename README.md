# RecMe
Aren't you tired of it? You want to find out what laptop suits your needs best, which book from the victorian era to read next, or which historical event was the coolest, but when researching you are forced to scan a million different websites, each of them suggesting different things. Atleast i am sick of it, so here comes this project to save the day. I will build a platform, where you can look for and recommend to everyone else: anything, more anythings and as detailed as possible at that.

To give an idea, you might search for the most recommended... : 
1. laptop 15" for gaming under 700â‚¬ 
2. funny rated r animated movies 
3. hip hop album from the 90s
4. movies about pirates starring johnny depp
5. educational youtubers/content creators
